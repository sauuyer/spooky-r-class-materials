# Haunted Places Data 
Downloaded from data world: https://data.world/timothyrenner/haunted-places

The original data comes from the Shadowlands Haunted Places Index, which contains a comprehensive set of haunted places in the United States and internationally. The dataset downloaded from data world has been scraped, cleaned and geocoded by Timothy Renner. This version of the data focuses on haunted US locations, though the Shadowlands Haunted Places Index does include haunted places outside of the US.

The code for scraping and geocoding (also created by Timothy Renner) is available on GitHub: https://github.com/timothyrenner/shadowlands-haunted-places.
